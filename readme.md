# AutoBrightness
Ever got blinded by a sudden blast of light mode? Well this programs aims to eliminate just that by automatically setting your brightness to a lower value when the content on your screen is brighter and higher when the contents are darker.

## How it works
- Takes all the pixels on the screen
- Converts all of them to greyscale (with weighted rgb values)
- averages the 'whiteness' of each pixel (range- 0 to 255)
